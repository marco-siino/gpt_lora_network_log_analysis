The 'FCnt' field shows the frame counter, which increments for each frame sent by the device. By comparing the 'dev_eui' and 'FCnt' values for each device across multiple rows, we can determine how many frames each device has sent. In this case, each device has a unique 'dev_eui' value, so we can simply count the number of rows with the same 'dev_eui' value to find the number of frames received by that device.\n",

The 'FCnt' field shows the frame counter, which increments for each frame sent by the device. By comparing the 'dev_eui' and 'FCnt' values for each device across multiple rows, we can determine how many frames each device has sent. In this case, each device has a unique 'dev_eui' value, so we can simply count the number of rows with the same 'dev_eui' value to find the number of frames received by that device.\n",
